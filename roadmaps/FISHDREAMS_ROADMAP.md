# Background


**Introduction** This tool allows providers to track cognitive assessments for high-risk MCI patients. This open-source project is designed to provide a standarized modular environment for digital psychometric analysis. The goal of this tool is to assist PCPs, Specialists, and Researchers obtain assessment data outside of the hospital environment at set frequencies. The software is not meant to replace existing providers, but provide additional data points to support a diagnosis.


**How it Works** This software is a web-based application that provides a portal for both patients and providers to access and perform assessments or assign assessments depending on their user rights. Each user will create a de-identified User Name in the hospital setting with the provider which will then be linked to their patient record through an EMR. The software does not contain PHI, rather it only tracks the measures which are assigned. The results of the measures will be accessible via the application for the individual user thorugh a reporting page. Providers can access the data through a secure API or directly through the application.


This web-based application is intended to be run on touch-enabled devices which include laptops and other mobile devices, not excluding other modalities which allow for a touch experience and have a modern browser.

# Phase 1: Alpha

### Assessment Standard Template

In order to create the standard that will be used for all assessment types, 
a commonly utilized script type should be used. In this case we are using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format.
Due to the anticipated dynamic nature of each assessment this is expected to evolve prior to the release of version 1.0. The goal is to establish a template that can vary greatly but using common elements and steps.
