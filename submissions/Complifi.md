Introduction
CompliFi is a tool that gives medical coders the flexibility to learn at their own pace from the comfort of your home or office. CompliFi helps medical coders keep their specialty training and certification up to date without the hassle. Our customer portal highlights the medical coding resources and learning services with a user-friendly interface. The example showing here focus on UI design of one specialty area: Interventional Radiology.  

How it Works
CompliFi will make certification and compliance assessments available in a single online portal. Users will be able to access CEU exams, webinars, courses both virtual and onsite, and purchasable learning tools in a single location based on their specialization. Once logged on users member dashboard will be customized to them allowing them to access only courses and other materials relevant to them. This will make the industry compliance of all users easier to maintain. 

Development
The prototype was designed in Photoshop. The online portal is currently being developed within a CMS that will have several apps integrated. This concept will only be available on desktop, however, it will have mobile settings to alert the customer on upcoming CEUs, webinars, and the latest news.
