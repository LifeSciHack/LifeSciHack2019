## Logitudinal Tracking of Cognitive Impairment

**Introduction**
This tool allows providers to track cognitive assessments for high-risk MCI patients. 
This open-source project is designed to provide a standarized modular environment for digital psychometric analysis.
The goal of this tool is to assist PCPs, Specialists, and Researchers obtain assessment data outside of the hospital environment at set frequencies.
The software is not meant to replace existing providers, but provide additional data points to support a diagnosis.

**How it Works**
This software is a web-based application that provides a portal for both patients and providers to access assigned assessment or assign assessments depending on their user rights. 
Each user will create a de-identified User Name in the hospital setting with the provider which will then be linked to their patient record through an EMR. 
The software does not contain PHI, rather it only tracks the measures which are assigned. The results of the measures will be accessible via the application for the individual user thorugh a reporting page.
Providers can access the data through a secure API or directly through the application.

This web-based application is intended to be run on touch-enabled devices which include laptops and other mobile devices, not excluding other modalities which allow for a touch experience and have a modern browser.
