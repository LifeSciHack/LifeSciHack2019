# i14y

**Introduction**
  
i14y is a medial health platform that promotes data interoperability and prioritizes patient privacy. The concept is to let your medical data travel with you, not have it siloed off in different isolated systems. A healthcare patient should be able to easily grant access to their health data, with appropriate permissions.
  
**How it Works**
  
The system comprises of two apps - one used by the patient, and one by the healthcare provider. 
  
The patient enters their personal data and generates a QR code tied to a hash. The doctor or healthcare provider can scan the code to gain access to their medical data stored in our database. This way, the data travels with the patient, and there are no delays in sharing data between different systems. No PII is stored in the database at any time. 

The database basically ties the patient hash to medical data. Different formats such as FHIR can be supported and potentially EHR records can be indexed as well. 

**Development**
    
The UI was designed in Angular using bootstrap. The backend is running on nodejs in a private server with a containerized MongoDB database.

**Installation Instructions**

The two angular apps can be installed used `npm install`. The backend server can be run using `node index.js`. A MongoDB instance must be running or it will automatically try to connect to the cloud database.
